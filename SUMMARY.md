# Clean Code Rules

- Write meaningful and descriptive variable, function, and class names.
- Keep functions and methods short and focused on a single task.
- Use comments sparingly and only when necessary to clarify intent or explain complex code.
- Write code that is easy to read and understand, avoiding overly clever or obscure constructs.
- Avoid duplication of code and strive for code reuse and modular design.
